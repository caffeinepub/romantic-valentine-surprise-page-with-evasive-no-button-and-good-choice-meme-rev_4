## Summary
**Goal:** Add a subtle, delightful interaction animation to the “Yes ❤️” button on the main Valentine proposal view without altering the existing Valentine flow.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a noticeable-but-subtle hover and/or click animation to the “Yes ❤️” button on the proposal screen.
- Ensure the “Yes ❤️” click behavior remains identical (still triggers confetti and transitions to the accepted view).
- Keep the evasive “No 💔” behavior unchanged (including up to 100 evasions) and do not change any user-facing text.

**User-visible outcome:** On the proposal screen, the “Yes ❤️” button feels more special via a subtle interaction animation, while all existing behaviors (confetti/accepted view and evasive “No 💔”) work exactly as before.
