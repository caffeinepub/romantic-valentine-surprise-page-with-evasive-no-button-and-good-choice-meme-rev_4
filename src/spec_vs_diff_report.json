  "summary": "REQ-8 (add a subtle interaction animation to the “Yes ❤️” button) appears to be implemented via new CSS animations described as heartbeat/glow on hover/click, while the App logic still shows Yes-click triggering confetti and accepted view. However, the diff also introduces additional unrequested UI/behavior changes (notably to the “No 💔” button behavior and global theme/styling), which may violate the non-goals/constraints about keeping the existing flow and evasive mechanics unchanged.",

      "description": "Added/changed evasive “No 💔” button behavior beyond simple evasion (introduces a wiggle state, delays before moving, and pointer-down handling), which is outside the request and risks changing the existing “No 💔” mechanics.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly states the evasive “No 💔” mechanics must remain unchanged; the diff shows new state/handlers and CSS animations specifically for the No button.",
